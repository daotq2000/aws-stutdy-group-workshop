#### Overview

We see VPC Endpoint connect between Lambda function and DynamoDB.

**Why need a VPC endpoint to connect it?**

+ VPC Isolation: When Lambda functions are configured to run within a VPC, they are isolated from the internet and can only access resources within the VPC or those reachable through VPC endpoints. This ensures a higher level of security by restricting external access.
+ DynamoDB Endpoint: DynamoDB is an AWS service that resides on the AWS network infrastructure. When accessed from within a VPC, Lambda functions need to communicate with DynamoDB through an interface known as a VPC endpoint. A VPC endpoint acts as a gateway that enables private communication between resources in your VPC and AWS services like DynamoDB without traversing the internet.
Private Subnet Access: Placing both Lambda functions and DynamoDB in the same private subnet ensures that communication between them remains private and does not traverse the public internet. This further enhances the security posture of the application.
By creating a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB within your VPC, Lambda functions in the same VPC can securely communicate with DynamoDB without the need for internet access. This setup ensures that data transmission between Lambda and DynamoDB remains secure and private, while also optimizing network performance by avoiding unnecessary internet routing.

**In summary, while Lambda functions and DynamoDB can coexist in the same private subnet within a VPC, Lambda functions require a VPC endpoint to establish connectivity with DynamoDB when operating within a VPC environment. This ensures secure and private communication between the two services without internet access to doesn't pay fee for internet outbound from AWS Pricing Model.**
