## Create file main.tf

    module "aws-resources" {
    source = "./aws-resources"
    }

## Explain

The code snippet you provided is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and appears to be part of a configuration file for managing AWS (Amazon Web Services) resources using Terraform, a popular infrastructure as code tool.

**Let's break it down:**

module "aws-resources": This line initiates the definition of a Terraform module named "aws-resources". Modules in Terraform are reusable packages of Terraform configurations, typically used to encapsulate a set of resources with specific functionality.

Putting it all together, this code block defines a Terraform module named "aws-resources" and specifies that its configuration should be loaded from the local directory "./aws-resources". Within that directory, you would expect to find a set of Terraform configuration files defining AWS resources to be managed by this module.
