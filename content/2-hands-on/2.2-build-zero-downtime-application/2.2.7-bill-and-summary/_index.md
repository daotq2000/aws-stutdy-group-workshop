## Summary

So we have completed the challenge of building a backend system with 0 downtime, this project is not just a practice exercise but a real project, the above deployment model has been applied. Widely used by medium and large sized companies, building such an architecture will speed up delivery to customers, not only improving performance and speed but also ensuring The application will always be stable, can scale horizontally, can increase/decrease resources depending on the amount. traffic and system resource usage. Not only that, this model also helps us protect resources. Critical resources are always safe in an internet-isolated environment. To be honest, this exercise is quite difficult, it takes a lot of time to learn and correct errors, but more than anything the benefits it brings are always worth the results.

Thanks for follow and watching, good luck to cloud journey.
