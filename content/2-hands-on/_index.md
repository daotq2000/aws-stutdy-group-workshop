#### Introduce
Hello friends,
I'm Dao, I'm currently working as a software engineer, I've only been learning about cloud computing for a few months. Luckily, I also successfully obtained an AWS certification **Solution Architect Associate** , which helped me understand an overview of AWS, improve my system development thinking, and act as a stepping stone for a smoother practice process.
I decided to create a website to share what I know about the process of learning cloud computing in 100 days. I believe that with my constant effort to learn, we will soon be able to master cloud computing. Cloud mathematics in the earliest and most profound way, come learn with me.
